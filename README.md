I'm working on creating a web component to eaisly set up UI for chess on the browser. My goal is to make the component configurable so that it is easy to use for chess variants like [Seirawan chess](http://www.seirawanchess.com/), and learn during the process. I've never done anything like this before, and hope it'll be fun.
